# Real-Time Multimedia Communication Application

This repository contains a **Real-Time Multimedia Communication Application** developed as part of my **Computer Networking course**. The project enables users to exchange text, images, and emojis in a group chat environment, with an emphasis on minimizing latency, providing scalability, and enhancing user interaction with multimedia content.

## Features

### 1. Real-Time Multimedia Communication
- **Instant Text, Image, and Emoji Exchange**:  
  Users can send and receive text messages, images, and emojis within designated groups in real time.
  
- **Optimized Responsiveness**:  
  The system focuses on optimizing thread efficiency to minimize latency, ensuring that multimedia content, such as images and emojis, is exchanged seamlessly and promptly.

### 2. Scalable and Modular Architecture
- **Scalable Design**:  
  The application is designed with scalability in mind, making it easy to accommodate future features, including new multimedia formats or additional communication tools.
  
- **Modular Structure**:  
  The project is built with a modular architecture, ensuring that updates and expansions can be easily integrated into the system without disrupting existing functionality.

### 3. User-Friendly Multimedia Interface
- **Intuitive and Visually Appealing UI**:
